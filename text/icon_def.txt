# mbmp.icon
#
# This icon definition file, located in the user's home directory, can be
# edited.  The purpose of this file is to facilitate the use of theme icons
# that are not part of the official Freedesktop.org naming specification. 
# 
# QT provides very good icon selection with a fallback mechanism.  In order
# to use it one must know the name of the theme icon you want.  This is 
# not a problem with the official named icons, but is if you want to support
# any icon theme since the name of any icon not part of the official 
# Freedesktop.org specification is up to the theme author.   
#
# This file basically describes the pictures to use for each icon.  Format 
# of the file is as follows:
#
# Comments are the # sign.  Any text on a line after the first # is treated
# as a comment.
#
# Each icon definition starts with the [icon] token and is terminated by a
# blank line.  Inside each icon block are various sections, each contained
# on one line. Each section contains a key and value pair separated by an
# equal (=) sign.
#
# icon_name = is the descriptive name of what the icon is to show.  This
# entry is read and used by the program and should not be edited.
#
# resource = is the location of the default picture which is hard coded
# into the program in a QResource file.  This can be edited provided you
# select another valid resource which must already exist.  You cannot add
# resources using this file.  This key/value pair is mandatory.
#
#	colorize = (no/yes, 0/1, or a color in the format RRGGBB) if yes or 1
# the internal icons will be colorized according to the value specified 
# from preferences.  If a color number is provided the icon will be colorized
# to the specified color.  If no or 0 then the icon is not colorized.
# Colorizing is only available for internal icons defined in the resource line. 
#
# fdo_name = is the name of one of the official Freedesktop.org named icons.
# This key/value pair is optional.
#
# theme_names = is a comma (,) separated list of theme icon names which 
# are not part of the Freedesktop.org specification. The list will be
# searched in order looking for each icon name in the current theme.
# This key/value pair is also optional.
#
# The text in a value field may contain the vertical delimiter (|) symbol.
# If it does the text on each side should be a complete resource path or
# theme icon name. Text to the left is the ON state of the icon, to the right
# is the OFF state. This is used for icons which show a different picture
# depending on state.  Play/Pause in a media player would be a classic example.
#
#	The text in a resource value field may also contain whitespace.  If
# it does the text on each side should be a complete resource path.  Left
# of the whitespace is the base picture in raw_art, to the right is the
# overlay file to place over the raw_art icon. This is only for
# internal icons from the resource file.
#
# If this file becomes corrupted by editing or by other means is can be 
# regenerated simply by deleting it, then stopping and starting CMST.
#
# Icon selections at runtime are as follows:
# If the -i (--icon-theme) command line switch or preferences setting is not
# used then the resource name specified here is used if found, if not found
# the hard coded internal icon will be used.
#
# If the -i (--icon-theme) command line switch or preferences settings is used     
# then icons are searched in the following order until one is found:
#   theme_names from left to right (match will only occur if one of the names
#               can be found in the current or specified theme.)
#   fdo_name
#   resource location as specified in this file
#   hard coded internal icon
